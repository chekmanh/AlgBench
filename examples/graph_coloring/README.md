# Graph Coloring

This is a quick study of which graph coloring heuristic of NetworkX performs best.
It is meant as an example for AlgBench and the general structure of a good study.

Graph coloring is an NP-hard problem that appears as subproblem in many contexts.
You can find more information on in on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring)

The documentation of NetworkX greedy heuristics for it, can be found [here](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.coloring.greedy_color.html#networkx.algorithms.coloring.greedy_color).

## Overview

* `_utils` provides utils used during the study. In this case just a database for the graph instances.
* `00_generate_instances.py` generates us a set of instances. In this case, I already ran the script. It generated the next file.
* `01_instances.zip` contains the graph instances generated by the previous script.
* `02_run_benchmark.py` runs a set of different algorithms on these instances.
* `03_benchmark_data` the data generated by the previous script.
* `04_check_results.ipynb` a simple notebook to check that the data looks fine.
* `05_process_results.py` converting the data into a simple pandas table which is easier and faster to work with. In some cases, the raw data can also be too much for a Git, so you can only share the reduced file.
* `06_simplified_results.json.zip` the simplified pandas table generated by the previous script.
* `07_analyze.ipynb` a quick analyzis of the results. For real studies, you would have multiple such files following as there are often multiple aspects of the benchmark to evaluate.
